# challenge_bento
Challenge proposed as a test for the flutter developer position, where it was necessary to recreate two screens of a marketplace app

- Flutter Version: 3.22.0
- Dart Version: 3.4.0 
- Application made in Flutter respecting the responsive characteristics, to be displayed on any device regardless of screen size.

Project characteristics:
- Folder modularization;
- Repository Pattern;
- MVC;
- Mock data in a json file;
- Go Router for application routing;
- GetIt for dependency injection;
- mobX for state management: I used mobX as a state manager because I find it facilitates separation of responsibilities, improves testability, and promotes cleaner and more readable code.
